            <h4>
                Explain the concept of Responsive Design. What does the term mean?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Responsive Design is something that should be kept in mind while creating webpages and websites. Implementing Responsive Design means that if anybody is looking at your webpage, the content and styling will not break depending on what their screen size is. This creates a good experience for anybody using the website since the website will adjust based on how the user is viewing it while also making it simple and easy to browse even when switching from a desktop to a mobile phone. 
            </p>
            <h4>
                How does responsive design relate to web technologies?
            </h4>
            <p>
                Web technologies relates to responsive designs because the web technologies are constantly updating and new techniques emerge. Somebody browsing on an older outdated browser or computer shouldn’t be left out of experiencing responsive designs on the website. For example, the web technology for creating something on the browser google chrome might be different than how the same thing is accomplished on the safari browser. Therefore, the web developer needs to keep in mind how to provide a great experience to most of their user base without making too many sacrifices. 
            </p>
           <h4>
                What did you learn about building web apps for different devices through your 
                research?
           </h4>
           <p>
            I learned a lot about experimenting with the webpage size and by shrinking the window into a smaller size, I can see how the page will react to someone browsing on a smaller screen. I then identify what areas of my page can be played around with like a font size for some text on the screen that I can change to relative units like vh or vw which represent a percent of the viewport that the user is seeing the webpage through. I also, did a lot of playing around with the inspect element tool on the browser which can also be reached quickly by pressing “ctrl + shift + i” and I can see how the website is made as well as see how the website would look like on a phone or a tablet very quickly. Also, something as simple as creating a glowing text can be done on the browser but depending on what browser people are using you would have to write different code, for example:
            <br><br>-webkit-animation: glow 1s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
            <br>-moz-animation: glow 1s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
            <br>animation: glow 1s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
           </p>
           <h4>
                Finally, describe your learning experience in the course.
           </h4>
           <p>
            This course was a great course to get started with the basics of web development and I felt that it was a little too slow paced for my liking and the assignments were very sparse even though they were detailed and had a lot of material on them. I would’ve really like having a lot more assignments that would be shorter and encompass the new topics learned throughout the week – kind of like OOP244 and DBS211. Although I did enjoy the detail that the course went into and we learned a lot of various technologies to use in website development, we didn’t get much of a chance to apply a lot of the technologies that we saw in this course. I would also like to see this course adopt a big project with multiple milestone throughout the course, maybe even starting at the beginning instead of the halfway point and incorporating github into it so that we can create an actual website to visit and have everything we learned about broken down in various webpages connected (I’m thinking something like a much less detailed w3schools webpage that will have only the things we learned this semester on it and in the next semester we would build on it as well).
